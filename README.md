# JavaScript-form-validation-project
In this project, I developed a comprehensive web-based form validation system using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
 The form verifies key user inputs such as name, email, phone number, and passwords to ensure data integrity and prevent bot submissions. Custom error messages are displayed when validation fails, providing a user-friendly experience.
